    Here you will find device classes available in the community. Device classes provide among others
    connectivity to equipment. So, if you want to connect your hardware to Tango Controls please check this catalogue.
    One or more device classes can be wrapped as a device server to connect one or more devices to your Tango control
    system. Tango imposes no limit on the number of devices or classes in a device server. It depends on the
    implementation of the device class.
